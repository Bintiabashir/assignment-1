                <h3>Food for a family</h3>
                <p>Food is one of the basic necessities of humans, and it stands first among all basic needs â€“ food,
                    shelter, and clothing. It is important as it nourishes the human body- sustaining the very
                    existences of humans. Over the years, food has taken a position beyond this. Food is now a social
                    instrument</p>

                <h3>Shelter for a family</h3>
                <p>Homeless shelters are a type of homeless service agency which provide temporary residence for
                    homeless
                    individuals and families. Shelters exist to provide residents with safety and protection from
                    exposure
                    to the weather while simultaneously reducing the environmental impact on the community. </p>
